          "Once upon a time  there was a young prince, who loved the fairest girl he ever saw, the Princess of the Fairest Land.

The Prince was blind and deaf. One day, he and his friends came to a great fairy village, but as they came near the village gate, there were two princesses waiting outside to welcome them.

He asked his friend, \"The king and queen will probably be here any minute.\" \"What could be more beautiful than their shining eyes?\" he asked. \"The Princess Princess will marry you and give you an heir,\" the princess said. \"But how could a prince have eyes like hers?

          "Once upon a time  we lived in a pretty small village with two sisters, and one brother. We were very happy and very much in love. Then I noticed that I was getting out of sync. All the time. But I didn't know what that was. I just was getting slower and slower. And I kept telling myself, 'This is it. I need to get back on track'. It's very hard to be yourself in a place where you have no one to share your pain. It takes a lot of courage. It does, actually. I've had it with this place, this place is killing me. Every day is like a funeral, you know? I guess you're just glad it's over. That is, you have to be grateful for the people you've met here. And the people that haven't. You don't have to go on living for these people. You can just make your way. You know? It's just a really sad, lonely life. Do you ever miss your family? I miss them, really. I do, actually, and I'm really trying to make it work. It's hard. But one day I'll be able to say, 'I miss my family, too'. "

They all came to visit him on a summer morning, and the boy of eight took the first one to his house. But what he did not know was that the children had all forgotten the boy of ten's name. It was a very nice summer morning, but at the house the children were all busy, and he did not see anyone from his childhood. He was so tired of all that work he decided to sit down and rest for a little. He sat down on the big rock and just gazed out over the sea. He had heard stories of sea monsters. I can't tell you how wonderful it was. There was a monster called \"Fish Tail\". And there was a monster known as \"Fish Lizard\".

          "Once upon a time  the world was ruled by a group of elites who controlled it with an iron fist. The Iron Fists were the elite warriors of the Knights of the Round Table. In order to control the Iron Fist, each Knight needed to be promoted from rank. When someone attained the rank of Knight, they would be granted an Iron Finger, which they could use on all enemies. This Iron Fingers could be used with the weapon The Iron Glove of Karras, which was a large iron claw with a pointed edge. The Knight of the Iron Table was also given a wooden cross and shield that protected his sword. Knights would earn experience and gain access to higher ranks, which could be earned by killing enemies or by gaining points of experience. If the Knight was granted a Knight\u2019s Cross, they could protect their shield and cross. Knight ranks and ranks were based on fighting skills. A Knight of Table would become Master Knight when the Knight\u2019s cross was increased to 3 or higher.

Well, they were all unwell and the coach didn't have the time to run a meeting. I decided that since we are going to be absent from practice for a week at least, and this week is the first we haven't been to play, we wanted to find out if anyone else could give us some advice on how to get our team back together. So I sent a message to all the girls in my class (I believe it was 15 of us) asking if any of us could go to the practice. Then I asked them if anyone of them could join me for the practice. My idea was to have the group of girls that were sick at the time, practice together, but at the same time, give some advice. I knew that I could not win this game with just my girls because it would be too easy. It is what it is! It worked! Our team won and we did a great ",
