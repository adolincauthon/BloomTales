          "Once upon a time  the world was in chaos. The people were living in fear and terror. They had no hope, they could not escape from their misery. They lived in fear of each other. There was an outbreak of plague that killed all the people except for one person who survived. He was saved by his faith. This story is called Noah's Ark. It tells us about how God created man out of clay. In our modern day we have many stories like this. We are told to be afraid of something or someone because it is bad. But if you look at history, there has never been anything like this. Noah's Ark is a good example of what happened in the past. It shows that when things get bad, God can save us. History teaches us that sometimes bad things happen to help us grow as human beings. If you want to learn more about Noah's Ark, read the Bible. You will find lots of information on it. Here is a picture of Noah's Ark. Look at the image. What do you think would happen if you saw this? Would you feel happy? Yes, I would feel happy. "

          "Once upon a time  the world was ruled by a group of people called the Great Powers. They were powerful, wealthy and feared. The world was governed in accordance with their rules and laws. But things changed when they discovered that there was another group of people living on earth who had different rules and laws than them. This new group of people became known as the Third World. It was very difficult for the Great Powers to govern because they could not control this new group of people. They wanted to know what happened to these other people. So they sent emissaries to ask questions about them. And they got some answers from the third world. The Great Powers finally realized that they had been wrong. The Third World is not like the Great Powers. The Third World has its own rules and laws. These are called the International Regulations. They are written down in international law books. The Great Powers have no authority over these regulations. Instead, the Great Powers give the International Regulations to the Third World. The Great Powers never want to see any more Third World governments. Because they think that it will cause chaos. "

Now the boy would never forget this moment until his last breath. At the same time, he also realized how much his mother cared for him. The boy then decided to become a better son. So he started taking care of his mother with love. Soon afterward, the boy became a father. A few years later, the boy's mother passed away too. But before she left, she told the boy: \"Be careful now because I am going to die soon\". After hearing this, the boy began to worry about death. In fact, he feared dying at any minute. This is called \"anticipation anxiety disorder\" or anticipatory grief. Anticipatory grief can cause severe depression, even suicidal thoughts.
