          "Once upon a time  we had a small boy named Hank. I grew up with him. What happened? He fell down the stairs. The back door's locked. And then it all started to happen. My mother was sick, my father just moved out of town for a couple months and we spent our time here. In between visits I'd come over to see you sometimes. Well, not that I really needed any company these days. Then when one of those moments came around you were gone. Your room was emptier than anything I've ever seen before. You left us there in bed alone for hours. Like something was wrong with me. I found it hard to believe at first but I kept on hoping he would come back. That his spirit was still alive somewhere else. Even after he died. But every day seemed so different. Wonderful times I remember, yes... but now things have changed again. Are we good friends? We're close. I've been looking into your past. The last year or so has been trying to sort out what you're doing here. Maybe I should stay for a while. - No. Why not? - It will take a few more "

          "Once upon a time  when I loved you so much that I said. \"You'd be right glad if I'd come back here.\"  It is strange how little we remember and do not understand the things in which our hearts yearn.  In truth, as with all matters of love or duty it depends on individual circumstances; for those who have had many experiences may see these more clearly than others.  There are certain periods in life at least during which we forget to enjoy ourselves, but we soon realise what an important thing it was and that no one would wish us off this earth without knowing our value and meaning. The only regret I ever feel about my marriage is that neither of us were able to take advantage of every opportunity offered by nature and get away for a few days before coming home and settling down permanently.  I am proud of being able to say to you girls who will make me happy some day: This happiness I now know is nothing compared with what awaits me yet!

What's going on out of my hair!?\" In case you're wondering how we found them, I've been talking with those two people before: one named Runevaldrakkarsson. he's our guardian angel. (Sighs) We don't have much information for him now except that he must've passed away long ago at age ten when his mother accidentally left their home in Svarlach island without saying goodbye (I'm guessing it wasn't by accident). That's about six months prior today.  On another note,  I'm looking forward tonight's event.  I believe it's because I've just met her; that's why she said yes so quickly.  She's from Troms\u00f8 but has spent most last year living around Rovaniemi due off work as an interpreter - though she's only known me since high school. (Well until college?)

          "Once upon a time  there was a landlocked province that could never change its seasons. In this case, the Province of Punjab (in the modern-day Pakistan). These provinces were known for their warmth and humid climate. The Punjabis have been known as the 'Persian kites' because of their propensity to fly. If you are in Punjab for a summer, do not think about leaving your suitcase unattended. Be prepared to bring everything necessary to live comfortably for at least one month, but in fact many people leave their bags unattended all day long during the monsoon. It is recommended to take up to five days of vacation when travelling to the south of India or other parts of South Asia to spend the rainy season from June to September. It is important to know that due to the Southern Hemisphere's lack of north westerlies, it does not rain here during the year. In the southern hemisphere, no one would dream of spending six weeks without receiving any sun, but what if we told you that it is only winter around these parts? We would probably say 'no!' No sunshine for the majority of the time. So plan for overcoming this "

          "Once upon a time  I was walking through the forest behind my house , when I noticed that there were two trees growing together . They seem to have grown from their root systems which are close and related as an ecosystem like a family of mammals . And each tree is telling me something about its life experience in these forests .  Their branches give advice on how to stay healthy : health issues such as diabetes , stroke , hypertension or even cancer may influence our physical condition positively or negatively .   It is quite clear that they communicate with each other and help us by showing us what works well for them and vice versa . There should be no problem finding out if a particular tree helps you with medical conditions or not . The communication among them can also reveal some aspects of spirituality but this has been left aside so far . Let 's start with examining why it makes sense to use different types of trees to treat individual diseases ( see later ) . Today we are talking about one type - the white ash tree . White ash belongs to the genus Ficus and is widely cultivated in South Asia and Japan because it produces yellow nuts "

Everything went just fine... until I discovered that I'd developed an eating disorder called Anorexia Nervosa (anorexy). Once again, everything changed for the worse - as it had before....and then everyone started talking in circles; why have people not gotten over themselves? Why can't they get away from their negative thoughts without getting killed or starving like all these other kids?  It would be easy enough if you weren't being bullied because of your weight loss but this is what happened too: The social media bully began sending out nasty comments on us through online forums such as: \"Beautiful baby girl has become extremely thin compared others who are healthy girls\"; \"Different skin tone make her less attractive than most women\" etc.. This resulted after another year spent trying vain attempts at losing pesoing so she might turn into someone else altogether when we tried together once more ... A waste! There were many times where one day things felt good during our diet period which turned around 10 minutes later due unhealthiness under heavy stress caused by food-related feelings rather bellyache .
