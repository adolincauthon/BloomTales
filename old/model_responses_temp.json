          "Once upon a time  a small group of local fishermen had a good fishing charter for a year or two, then when they were caught off the coast, they had to go to the nearest town to get their gear back. Nowadays, fishing is more like a sport, and the fisherman has a better gear and a higher catch rate. There are also regulations about how many fish to catch and how much they should weigh. But what about the fishermen themselves? They continue to be fishermen. They need to fish, even if they are not caught. However, the fishing industry is in a strong position because there are more and more people interested in fishing. For example, if you see a fly fishing tournament on TV, you might think that it is a great sport. It is very popular and attracts a lot of people to it. You might not know that the TV shows and other media are part of the entertainment industry. An important part in the growth of a fishery is the increase in interest from the public. The public becomes interested when a particular fish is caught or an event is happening. More andmore people "

But he couldn't play baseball because he didn't have the money to play. So he decided to take up football. And he played football until he could get the $18 to buy a football for himself. His mother saw the child play the football and said, \"That's good, my son. You are good at football, but you don't know baseball.\" The boy was embarrassed and didn't know how to answer. The mother said to him, \"Well, I know that you are a poor boy, and you have nothing else to offer. \"Now, you know what you must do. Get the ball. Use the hands to hit the baseball and try to win. That's what you'll do if you want to become a good baseball athlete. It was very simple. A little child had to decide whether to try his best to succeed or to give up.
