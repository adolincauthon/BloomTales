          "Once upon a time  the world was peaceful Now it's a mess - How is it going? - Getting along, thanks. It's really getting tough being a police officer. I keep saying the best way to handle a situation is to do it. - Not with my hands. - With my teeth. You're right. A bad mouth can be a very dangerous weapon. It's easy to make a bad situation worse. When you've worked hard to keep a door locked and a window up... that's the easy way to get someone else to open a door... or to make a window up. If someone else comes in through the window, they can make an entrance. The key to being a good cop is being able to handle your own situations. I don't know what it was that made you two break up, but at least you both tried. You're gonna have to learn to stand up for yourself if you're gonna be a cop. I was talking to a friend about this. A cop... in the 21st century... is like a chef, trying to make his food delicious. Every single day, he's trying to learn how to use his hands to make the best ",

And, then, his mother, she got very angry and she had a bad dream. And she had a terrible nightmare.

They put up a sign on the front  of their home telling people that the house was going to fall down and they were  looking for a buyer for it.  The family who lived there got angry at the owner and then set up their own  front door  which looked like the old owner's home.  Everybody at that home was afraid of the new owner, so they named it Home for the Oldest Family.  After the signs came up, everyone who ever saw the home started to live out of it and not  wanted to see the other houses around it.The house which had to go down was not the oldest one on its own.

A group  of fellows in college called me in and they told me they were there too. The fellers on this particular cliff were my brothers. We sat down and had drinks and played cards for a few hours, and then we hung out and ate. It was a good time.Then one night, about four years ago, my brother and I had a long talk. He told us about his dreams and how he thought he wanted to start his own band. His dreams have come true. In the meantime, we have gone through several deaths and tribulations together, especially my older brother. My brother has been murdered. But at last, he has died. At first, I was surprised. After a couple of weeks, though, it became clear that the brother of mine died a lot longer than that. I took some things and left the group and did not return.

          "Once upon a time  the world's oldest recorded song was recorded in a tree. In the 18th century a group of London artists who were collecting antiques discovered an 18th century map of Britain, which showed a series of rivers which they assumed to be ancient Rhine. After identifying the source of the river they searched in the Rhine for any potential song. They found a river which was then named after them, Rhine River. In 1862 the Rhineland German name was given to the whole river, from this time onwards the German name has been given to all of the Rhines. Although a lot has changed in the history of music since then, the German Rhine river song has not changed. In Germany the word for a river Rhine means River and in German words it means Rhine song. Aside from a couple of different spelling variations, Rhines is still a river. The origin of the word 'Rhin' in the name Rhine is unknown. The source of this river is either a river or a river estuary which was dried up after a flood. Rhine and river have always been synonymous in German. Rhines river is also a river "
