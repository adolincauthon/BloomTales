          "Once upon a time  there was a place called Tokyo I made my way from the capital to Kamakura In this town, people were living happily for a long time Soon, the name of our town was written on the city walls Our old town hall is here Today we have come here and take off our clothes. Goodbye! What happened? The fire broke out because of some small misunderstanding between me and Maki. I'll say it once more. - No, I... - Don't worry. If you keep saying no, you'll get stuck here forever! Don't think about it. Go away! Wait! Isn't this a mistake? You haven't understood one thing yet. Shut up and let's go! We'll go tomorrow. Shall we go now? Maki. I know what I'm doing. When we reach Kamakura, I'll tell you everything. But right now you're in trouble, aren't you? I'm sorry if I've been annoying you. What should we do with him? He seems very sad. Come. He must be waiting for us there at the police station. It's not like he's always wandering around like that. He's probably working for someone. How could he work for someone who didn't even live in this country? ",

Take that man back to the old town and destroy him. Don't forget, I didn't have to do this alone. I mean, with someone like you around... We don't know if it can go right. Well, then, I guess you'll be safer here at my home than anywhere else on earth. Do you think I'm afraid of you? No, no. I'm not afraid of you. Then how am I afraid of you? Are you afraid of me? Who's gonna stop me now? Nobody is gonna stop you. That's what makes us so good friends. If we got along, you'd never be able to kill me. Maybe that's why you come all these times to kill me. - Well, maybe we can work out some sort of agreement. - But, but! You want the money? I ain't gonna give it to nobody. Only to me. Come in, please. So, Mr. Glover. Where are your wife and daughter? They came back with me about an hour ago. Good. Now, you're going downstairs. We'll meet "

          "Once upon a time  there was the great Druid king of Bhandal. He had just set out to lead his army through the Valley of Thunderdark and attack their enemy, Odin himself. The night before he left for war, his father and mother brought him some flowers, his sisters and brothers and all the others in his kingdom with them. There were many gifts as well, but they did not quite bring together what was wanted by this young man; he lacked only courage. That is why I was invited here! I have come from far away and I came hoping you would give me your blessing on my journey.\" Thorin made no reply, or at least not yet. When the King of Woden found that Thorin was not coming back, he decided to make an offer for his son's life.  \"Make sure your boy stays alive during the whole battle! He will be more valuable than gold.\"  \"A gift worth 100 golden mithrandirons should save us both our lives!\" Thorin exclaimed.  \"We agree!\" said the King of Woden. \"Tell me, how do we know that the people here will understand what needs to be done?

People started believing you're dead. They're coming after you. They killed Sarge Leckey and were trying to kill the man who helped you escape. Now they're looking for you, and you'll die. I have no idea why they've done it. I think it's because the FBI has come along too late, Mr. President. So much of what's going on is "

This isn't about you getting in trouble for playing with your own daughter's dolls on Fridays or whatnot; this one has been very strange and we think it's best if we're going out together tonight as soon as possible so I'm thinking maybe it would make more sense if you'd just get home now.

Yes! When my parents had been separated for long periods I dreamt about them again and then realised I didn't really understand what it meant anymore. It all seemed so real but I couldn't believe that the reason why these amazing experiences were happening was because I loved your father more than anything on earth... this is how I felt when he passed away six years ago.But now you're leaving, I've never seen anyone else crying as hard before nor can I imagine losing someone close enough. So that's all right if we're going home soon. It's just one big trip without our children. Huh? Aren't you glad it's finally over?Of course not! It's too much grief I'm afraid, isn't there any other way?What do you mean no other way? We have to leave right now since we can't be here after tomorrow.That's impossible, Dad!No!

When the boy was young he would watch his father play tennis and imagine he could play it as well. He always hoped for the day when he could have his own tennis court at home.

After determining the scope of my search, here is where it starts... A keyword (or two) from any topic. Once I find what exactly I want to find out, I use these keywords to search the internet and look up. In order to see which web sites answer my question correctly, I use the SERPs. Search Engine Results Pages. If you know what they are... yes.... that's right ... SERP stands for Search Engine [Page] Response. They are actually a list of websites that have searched or referred people who were using those specific keywords. And finally ... The search results!

She liked playing with others but did not like talking much because she thought it wasn't good for her speech. At first all the girls who knew her enjoyed meeting her; however when the social gatherings became longer she became increasingly withdrawn. Later on one day her mother sent them home early so that they would have some alone time together. The last few months had been very difficult for Alice and Jane as their parents were dying of illnesses. Now the only thing they needed is a small amount of time together.
