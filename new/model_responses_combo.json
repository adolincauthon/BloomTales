And every morning I would go there with my father. He'd always tell me stories about his childhood. One day he told me about how he used to play hide-and-seek. When he found someone hiding behind a tree, he would shout, \"Hey!\" And if anyone answered him, he'd yell, \"Stop hiding!\" And they'd run away from each other. And when they were finally caught, they'd get into a fight. And sometimes they'd end up fighting over who got first. But at least they could laugh together. And that's what I wanted to do as well. "
