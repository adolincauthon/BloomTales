John was rich because he was born rich, and his parents had been rich for a long time. But he had to work hard to earn his money, because his father was poor and he didn't have much money to spend. So he worked hard. And he earned a good salary. Then he bought a nice car. The car was expensive, but he liked it. It was nice to drive. When he went to the movies, he would drive his car to see the movie. That was his hobby. There was no other hobby for him. One day, his mother died. She was just a poor old woman. Her parents died, too. Now he lived with his aunt. Aunt was not very nice. After his mother's death, John's aunts took over his house. Their behavior was bad. Because of that, the boy was unhappy. At first, it was hard for John to get along with the aunty. Later, when he got used to it, they were good to him, "

That was all he liked. Then he got a job. A job that was not very good. It was hard work. In the end, the man got fired. Now he is very sad. Because he has no one to talk to. No one can talk with him. Nobody can help him, because nobody can understand him and nobody understands him because of his poor condition. I think that this is a sad story. We all have to live in poverty. If we don't live like this, we will never be rich, and we won't be happy. This is the sad truth. There is no happiness in wealth.
